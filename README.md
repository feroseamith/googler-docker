## Googler in a docker container with links2

[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/hurturk/googler-docker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/hurturk/googler-docker/)

I often use [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler) with `--json` option however you can still open URLs within terminal.

Example Usage:

    $ docker run -it --rm hurturk/googler-docker --count 3 learn flask


`googler-docker` isn't affiliated to Google in any way.

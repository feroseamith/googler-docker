## Googler in a docker container with links2

I often use [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler) with `--json` option however you can still open URLs within terminal.

Example Usage:

    docker run -it --rm hurturk/googler --json learn go

`googler-docker` isn't affiliated to Google in any way
